<h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> 
    I am a professional with a strong foundation in both software development and telecommunications, driven by a growing passion for programming and technology. I hold an Associate's Degree in Computer Software Development and a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering, which have provided me with a solid academic background.
    My career began as a MySQL Developer (2008-2010), followed by a role as a Software Developer (2010-2017) in the Dominican Republic. In 2018, I shifted my focus to telecommunications, working in fiber splicing until 2020. During this time, I also worked as a third-party contractor for Comcast as a Headend Tech (2020-2021) and currently hold a similar position with Spectrum, where I have been employed since 2022.</p>

   <p> In addition to my telecommunications experience, I have developed expertise in internet installation, node splitting, and data center infrastructure, specializing in running Coaxial, Ethernet, and Fiber cables, as well as Ladder Rack and Rack installation.</p>
    
   <p> On the software development side, I am actively expanding my knowledge in programming. Currently, I am learning C# and exploring ASP.Net Core 9, while also gaining hands-on experience with Visual Studio Code and .NET Core. I recently developed an application using Angular to manage a list of favorite Pok√©mon, integrating it with a database and an external API. To further enhance my skills, I am familiarizing myself with Git and GitHub for version control.</p>
    
   <p> My technical skill set includes Networking, Fiber Splicing, Data Center Infrastructure, MySQL, MS SQL Server, C#, Git, GitHub, and Angular, making me a versatile and adaptable professional in both the software development and telecommunications fields.</p>
